Improving your games
====================

Here are some tips that will enable you to enhance your games.



Joystick input
--------------

You may call them *joysticks* or *controllers*, but Raylib calls them
*gamepads*.

Some controllers have different inputs and some are not compatible at
all so donâ€™t be surprised if this doesnt work properly! PS4 and Xbox One
controllers connected by USB cable seems to work best.

.. literalinclude:: programs/14_joystick_input.py
   :caption: Joystick input
   :name: code-joystick_input
   :linenos:



.. topic:: Optional, if you have a controller

   Make the alien move up and down as well as left and right using the controller.  Do the same for any other examples that use the keyboard!


Colours
-------

.. Note::
   The word *colour* is incorrectly spelt *color* in American programs such as Raylib.
   We will try to use the correct spelling wherever we can but sometimes you will have to use
   *color*.

Instead of using ready made colours like ``RED``, ``YELLOW``, etc. you can
create your own colour with a *tuple* of three numbers. The numbers must
be between 0 - 255 and represent how much *red*, *green* and *blue* to
mix together.

.. literalinclude:: programs/25_colours.py
   :caption: RGB colours
   :name: code-colours
   :linenos:



.. topic:: Advanced

   Change the green and blue amounts to make different colours.


.. topic:: Exercise

   Make a gray colour.


.. topic:: Advanced

   Make random colours.




Using loops
-----------

The loops from :numref:`codeloop` are useful for
graphical games too! Here we draw red circles using a *for loop*.

We draw green circles using a *loop within another loop*.

.. literalinclude:: programs/20_loops.py
   :caption: Loops are useful
   :name: code-loops
   :linenos:



.. topic:: Exercise

   `import random` at the top of the program and then make the positions random, e.g::

      x = random.randint(0, 100)



.. topic:: Advanced

    Learn about RGB colour and make random colours (see :numref:`code-colours`).


.. topic:: Advanced

   Create a timer variable and change colours based on time (see :numref:`code-timer`)


Fullscreen mode
---------------

Sometimes it is nice to play your game using the entire screen rather
than in a window. This programs show how to enter fullscreen and and how to quit.

.. literalinclude:: programs/26_fullscreen_mode.py
   :caption: Fullscreen mode
   :name: code-full_screen_mode
   :linenos:

.. note::

   RLZero **automatically** uses the *F* key for fullscreen and *Escape* key to quit, so
   you don't actually need this code in your programs unless you want to use a different key.




Displaying the score
--------------------

This game shows how you can keep the score in a variable and print it on
to the game screen. You can display any other messages to the player the
same way.

.. literalinclude:: programs/27_displaying_text.py
   :caption: Keeping score in a variable and displaying it
   :name: code-displaying_text
   :linenos:



.. topic:: Exercise

    Make the score text larger.


.. topic:: Advanced

   Add a second player who presses a different key and show their score too.


.. topic:: Exercise

   Add text to one of your other games.
