# Tutorial: Shooting game

In this chapter we will build a shooting game together, step by step.  The Python we will use is: conditionals, loops, lists and functions.

## Step 1: Decide what Actors you will need

Our game will need these Actors, so **we must create images for all of them and save them as `.png` files in the `images` folder.**

| variable name | image file name | image size | description       |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| player        | player.png      | 64x64 | player's spaceship     |
| background    | background.png  | 600x800 | image of stars       |
| enemies (list)| enemy.png       | 64x64 | evil alien             |
| bullets (list)| bullet.png      | 16x16  | fired by the player   |
| bombs (list)  | bomb.png        | 16x16 | dropped by the enemies |

The `player` and `background` variables will contain Actors.  The others are lists which
we initialize to the empty list `[]`.  Actors will be appended to the lists later.

## Step 2: Draw your Actors

Every Pygame game needs an `draw()` function, and it should draw all the Actors we created above.

\begin{codelisting}

\label{code:shoot17b}
<<(programs/shoot17b.py)
\end{codelisting}


\newpage

## Step 3: Move your Actors

Every Pygame game needs an `update()` function to move the Actors, check for collisions, etc.

\begin{codelisting}
\codecaption{Shooter game part 3 of 4}
\label{code:shoot17c}
<<(programs/shoot17c.py)
\end{codelisting}


\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{}
\noindent Create the png image files (`player.png, background.png, bullet.png, bomb.png, enemy.png`).  Type in program \ref{code:shoot17a}, \ref{code:shoot17b} and \ref{code:shoot17c} into a single file.  Save the file.  Why doesn't it run?
\end{aside}

\newpage

## Step 4: Define your functions

Python cannot call a function that has not yet been defined.  Therefore we must at least provide empty, dummy versions
of our functions that don't do anything so we can fill them in later.  However Python cannot define a completely empty
function - it must contain at least one line.  Therefore we use the `pass` keyword to create a line that doesn't do anything.

\begin{codelisting}
\codecaption{Shooter game part 4 of 4}
\label{code:shoot17d}
<<(programs/shoot17d.py)
\end{codelisting}

\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{}
\noindent Add listing \ref{code:shoot17d} to the end of the file.  Verify the game now runs and you can see the player at the bottom of the screen.  (He can't move yet.)
\end{aside}

## Create enemies

Add this new function to the end of the program, and then call it immediately.  It uses a loop within a loop to create enemy Actors and put them in the `enemies` list.
The reason we put this in a function is we will need to call it again at the start of each level.

```python
def create_enemies():
    for x in range(0, 600, 60):
        for y in range(0, 200, 60):
            enemy = Actor("enemy", (x, y))
            enemy.vx = level * 2
            enemies.append(enemy)


create_enemies()
```

## Move the player

Replace the `move_player()` dummy function definition with this.  Remember **there can only be one function with a given name**.  *There cannot be two `move_player()` function
definitions.*

```python
def move_player():
    if keyboard.right:
        player.x = player.x + 5
    if keyboard.left:
        player.x = player.x - 5
    if player.x > WIDTH:
        player.x = WIDTH
    if player.x < 0:
        player.x = 0
```

\newpage

## Move the enemies

Replace the `move_enemies()` dummy function definition with this:

```python
def move_enemies():
    global score
    for enemy in enemies:
        enemy.x = enemy.x + enemy.vx
        if enemy.x > WIDTH or enemy.x < 0:
            enemy.vx = -enemy.vx
            animate(enemy, duration=0.1, y=enemy.y + 60)
        for bullet in bullets:
            if bullet.colliderect(enemy):
                enemies.remove(enemy)
                bullets.remove(bullet)
                score = score + 1
        if enemy.colliderect(player):
            exit()
```

## Draw text on the screen

Replace the `draw_text()` dummy function definition with this:

```python
def draw_text():
    screen.draw.text("Level " + str(level), (0, 0), color="red")
    screen.draw.text("Score " + str(score), (100, 0), color="red")
    screen.draw.text("Lives " + str(lives), (200, 0), color="red")
```

## Player bullets

Add this new function to the end of the program.  Pygame will call it for us automatically when a key is pressed.

```python
def on_key_down(key):
    if key == keys.SPACE and len(bullets) < MAX_BULLETS:
        bullet = Actor("bullet", pos=(player.x, player.y))
        bullets.append(bullet)
```

Replace the `move_bullets()` dummy function definition with this:

```python
def move_bullets():
    for bullet in bullets:
        bullet.y = bullet.y - 6
        if bullet.y < 0:
            bullets.remove(bullet)

```

## Enemy bombs

Replace the `create_bombs()` dummy function definition with this:

```python
def create_bombs():
    if random.randint(0, 100 - level * 6) == 0:
        enemy = random.choice(enemies)
        bomb = Actor("bomb", enemy.pos)
        bombs.append(bomb)
```

Replace the `move_bombs()` dummy function definition with this:

```python
def move_bombs():
    global lives
    for bomb in bombs:
        bomb.y = bomb.y + 10
        if bomb.colliderect(player):
            bombs.remove(bomb)
            lives = lives - 1
            if lives == 0:
                exit()
```

\newpage

## Check for end of level

Replace the `check_for_end_of_level()` dummy function definition with this:

```python
def check_for_end_of_level():
    global level
    if len(enemies) == 0:
        level = level + 1
        create_enemies()
```

## Ideas for extension

* Draw an explosion image and create an explosion Actor every time an alien dies.

* Make the explosion Actor disappear after a short time.

* Draw several explosion images, put them in a list and make the Actor animate displaying each of them in order.

* The player can only fire 3 bullets at a time.  Create a powerup that allows him to fire additional bullets.

* Add music and sound effects.
