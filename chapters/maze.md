# Tutorial: Maze game

In this chapter we will build a maze game together, step by step.  The Python we will use is quite simple: mostly just conditionals and loops.
The technique of creating a tilemap is common in games and after seeing it here you should be able to incorporate it into your own projects.

## Tilemap

A tilemap uses a small number of images (the tiles) and draws them many times to build a much larger game level (the map).
This saves you from creating a lot of artwork and makes it very easy to change the design of the level on a whim.  Here we create a maze level.

We must create three image files for the tiles: `empty.png`, `wall.png` and `goal.png` and save them in the `mu_code/images` folder (accessible with the
`images` button in Mu).

They must each be 64×64 pixels.  For the player
we will use the built in `alien` image.

\begin{codelisting}

\label{code:maze2}
<<(programs/maze2.py)
\end{codelisting}

The filenames of the tile images are stored in a *list*, `tiles`.
The level design is stored in a list of lists, more commonly called a *two dimensional array*.  There are 8 rows
and 8 columns in the array.  If you change the size of the array you will need to change the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` values too.
The numbers in the `maze` array refers to elements in the `tiles` array.  So `0` means `empty` and `1` means `wall`, etc.

![Tile grid\label{fig:maze_fig_grid}](images/figures/maze2.png)

To draw the maze we use a `for` loop within another `for` loop.  The outer loop iterates over the rows and the inner loop
iterates over the columns, i.e. the elements of the row.

## Moving the player

Add this code to the *end* of the program:

```python
def on_key_down(key):
    row = int(player.y / TILE_SIZE)
    column = int(player.x / TILE_SIZE)
    if key == keys.UP:
        row = row - 1
    if key == keys.DOWN:
        row = row + 1
    if key == keys.LEFT:
        column = column - 1
    if key == keys.RIGHT:
        column = column + 1
    player.x = column * TILE_SIZE
    player.y = row * TILE_SIZE
```

This function will be called automatically by Pygame, like `draw()` and `update()`.  However `on_key_down()` is not called every frame; it is
only called when the player presses a key.  The key that was pressed is passed to the function in the `key` *parameter*.

\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{}
\noindent Run the program and move the player.  Are there any problems with the movement?
\end{aside}

\newpage

## Restricting where the player can move

Delete the last two lines of the program and replace them with this modified version:

```python
    tile = tiles[maze[row][column]]
    if tile == 'empty':
        player.x = column * TILE_SIZE
        player.y = row * TILE_SIZE
    elif tile == 'goal':
        print("Well done")
        exit()
```


\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{}
\noindent Run the program and check that the player now *only* moves if the tile is empty.
\end{aside}

\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{}
\noindent Check that the game ends when the player reaches the goal.
\end{aside}

## Animate the movement of the player

First, the alien Actor is bit too big.  Draw a new image of size 64×64 pixels and save it as `player.png` in the `images`
folder.  In the program, change the line:

```
player = Actor("alien", anchor=(0, 0), pos=(1 * TILE_SIZE, 1 * TILE_SIZE))
```


to

```python
player = Actor("player", anchor=(0, 0), pos=(1 * TILE_SIZE, 1 * TILE_SIZE))
```

Next, the movement of the Actor is sudden and jerky.  Luckily Pygame includes a function to do smooth movement for us automatically.  Find these lines of the program: 

```
    if tile == 'empty':
          player.x = column * TILE_SIZE
          player.y = row * TILE_SIZE
```
          
replace them with:
 
```python
    if tile == 'empty':
        x = column * TILE_SIZE
        y = row * TILE_SIZE
        animate(player, duration=0.1, pos=(x, y))

```

\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{}
\noindent Verify the player image has changed and moves smoothly.
\end{aside}


## Create an enemy

We will create a simple enemy that moves up and down.  Add this code near the top just *above* the `draw()` function.

```python
enemy = Actor("enemy", anchor=(0, 0), pos=(3 * TILE_SIZE, 6 * TILE_SIZE))
enemy.yv = -1
```

To make the enemy visible, add this line at the end of the `draw()` function, after the player is drawn:

```python
  enemy.draw()
```

`enemy.yv` is the velocity in the y-axis direction (up and down).  Add these lines to end of the program (still inside the `on_key_down()`
function) to make the enemy move and reverse velocity when it hits a wall.

```python
    # enemy movement
    row = int(enemy.y / TILE_SIZE)
    column = int(enemy.x / TILE_SIZE)
    row = row + enemy.yv
    tile = tiles[maze[row][column]]
    if not tile == 'wall':
        x = column * TILE_SIZE
        y = row * TILE_SIZE
        animate(enemy, duration=0.1, pos=(x, y))
    else:
        enemy.yv = enemy.yv * -1
    if enemy.colliderect(player):
        print("You died")
        exit()
```


\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{}
\noindent Verify that the enemy moves up and down and kills the player.
\end{aside}

\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{Advanced}
\noindent Make another enemy that moves horizontally (left and right).
\end{aside}

\begin{aside}
\label{}
\heading{Advanced}
\noindent The collision detection is quite lenient (i.e. buggy) because it only tests for collisions between the
enemy and player when a key is pressed.  Define a new function called `update()` and move the collisions detection there
so that is called every frame.
\end{aside}

## A locked door and a key

We will add two new tiles to the game.  Draw images `door.png` and `key.png` and save them in `images` folder.

Find the `tiles` list near the top and **change** it to include the new images, and modify the `maze` with some number 3s and 4s where
you want to new tiles to appear.  Mine looks like this:

```python
tiles = ['empty', 'wall', 'goal', 'door', 'key']
unlock = 0

maze = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]
```

At the top of the program, create a new variable to store the number of keys the player is carrying:

```python
unlock = 0
```

Find the `if` statement where we test for `goal`:

```
   if tile == 'goal':
        print("Well done")
        exit()
```

Modify it like this to also test for the key and door tiles.  Since we are modifying a *global* variable inside a function we must declare it.

```python
    global unlock
    if tile == 'goal':
        print("Well done")
        exit()
    elif tile == 'key':
        unlock = unlock + 1
        maze[row][column] = 0 # 0 is 'empty' tile
    elif tile == 'door' and unlock > 0:
        unlock = unlock - 1
        maze[row][column] = 0 # 0 is 'empty' tile
```

## Ideas for extension

However that is not the end!  There are many things you could add to this game.

* Show the player score.
* Coins that the player collects to increase score.
* Trap tiles that are difficult to see and kill the player.
* Treasure chest that is unlocked with the key and increases score.
* Instead of ending the game, give the player 3 lives.
* Add more types of tile to the map: water, rock, brick, etc.
* Change the player image depending on the direction they are moving.
